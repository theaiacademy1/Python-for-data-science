    "* **Brand:** What brand is the car? Is it a BMW, Mercedes, or something else?\n",
    "* **Not Repaired Damage.** This string variable indicates if the car has any unrepaired damage. If the value is \"yes,\" it means there has been damage that hasn't been repaired. If it's \"no,\" the damage has been repaired and rectified. You can see how this might significantly affect the car's price.\n",
    "* **Date Created:** The date when the ad was created on Storm Motors.\n",
    "* **Postal Code:** The postal code of the seller, which can provide location-specific information.\n",

    "### Steps to Approach the Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Cleaning**\n",
    "   - **Check for Missing Values**: Identify any missing data in our dataset and decide how to handle it.\n",
    "   - **Identify Outliers**: Look for data points that don't make sense, like a car with a price of $0 or a car with an unusually low power value. Outliers can distort the predictions and need to be addressed.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**\n",
    "   - **Descriptive Statistics**: Get an overview of the data distribution, central tendencies, and spread.\n",
    "   - **Visualization**: Use plots to understand the relationships between variables. This can help in identifying patterns and insights that are not immediately obvious.\n",
    "   \n",
    "3. **Feature Engineering**\n",
    "   - **Handle Categorical Variables**: Convert categorical variables into numerical format using techniques like one-hot encoding.\n",
    "   - **Scale Numerical Variables**: Normalize or standardize numerical variables to ensure they're on a comparable scale, which can improve model performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Model Building**\n",
    "   - **Train Multiple Models**: We'll try different regression algorithms (e.g., linear regression, decision trees, random forests) and evaluate their performance.\n",
    "   - **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimize model parameters to improve performance.\n",
    "   \n",
    "5. **Model Evaluation**\n",
    "   - **Evaluate Performance**: Use metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared to assess how well the model is performing.\n",
    "   - **Choose the Best Model**: Select the model that provides the best balance of accuracy and generalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Importance of Handling Outliers\n",
    "\n",
    "Identifying and handling outliers is crucial in this case study. Outliers can skew the results and lead to inaccurate predictions. Here are two ways to handle outliers:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Formal Mathematical Methods**: Techniques like the Z-score or the Interquartile Range (IQR) can be used to identify outliers quantitatively.\n",
    "2. **Common Sense Approach**: Sometimes, common sense is enough to spot outliers. For instance, a car priced at $0 or a car with a power value of 1 HP is clearly an outlier and should be removed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example: Identifying Outliers\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's consider the car price as an example. If most car prices are within the range of $1,000 to $50,000, but there are a few entries with a price of $100,000 or $0, those entries could be considered outliers. Similarly, if the car's power typically ranges between 50 HP to 500 HP, any entry with an exceptionally low or high value might be an outlier.\n"

    "### Combining Categories with Low Frequency\n",
    "\n",
    "When you have categories with very low frequency, it can be beneficial to combine them with other categories to create a more compact and manageable dataset. This helps in reducing noise and making the model more robust. For example, if you have a car brand that appears only a few times, you might combine it with another brand to streamline the analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Filtering Data Based on Logical Checks\n",
    "\n",
    "It's crucial to filter the dataset to remove any illogical or incorrect entries. For instance:\n",
    "- **Price**: If there are entries with a price of $0 or an unrealistically high price, these should be removed.\n",
    "- **Year of Registration**: If the year of registration is beyond 2019 or far before the expected range, these entries should be removed.\n",
    "- **Power**: Similarly, if the power value of the car is unrealistic, it should be filtered out.\n",

    "### Linear Regression and Random Forest\n",
    "\n",
    "We will explore two different techniques for predicting the price of pre-owned cars:\n",
    "1. **Linear Regression**: This technique tries to fit a linear model to the data. It's simple, easy to understand, and interpret. It helps in analyzing variable importance straightforwardly.\n",
    "2. **Random Forest**: This is a non-linear technique that often performs better than linear regression on complex datasets. However, it is more complex and harder to interpret.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Choosing the Right Model\n",
    "\n",
    "Choosing between linear regression and random forest depends on:\n",
    "- **Model Complexity**: Linear regression is simpler and more interpretable, while random forest can handle more complexity but is harder to explain.\n",
    "- **Performance**: If the random forest provides significantly better predictions, it might be worth using despite the complexity.\n",
    "- **Application**: If the model needs to be embedded in optimization processes, simplicity might be preferred.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Regression Diagnostics and Assumption Checks\n",
    "\n",
    "After building a linear regression model, we need to perform regression diagnostics to check if the assumptions of linear regression hold true for our data. These assumptions include:\n",
    "- **Linearity**: The relationship between the independent and dependent variables should be linear.\n",
    "- **Homoscedasticity**: The residuals (errors) should have constant variance.\n",
    "- **Normality**: The residuals should be normally distributed.\n",
    "- **Independence**: The observations should be independent of each other.\n"
